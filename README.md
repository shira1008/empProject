# Employee Management Project

A responsive React + TypeScript app to display employee data.
I used a JSON file to simulate an API fetch for the data :)

I wrapped the API fetch with a try/catch block to handle errors, inside a useEffect with [], so the data fetch happens a single time and doesnâ€™t repeat on every render.

I used states to handle the error message, the current employee to display, track the current page for pagination, and to control the navbar class depending on the screen size.
